# Walk This Way

## Description

Have you ever followed a route from a walking guidebook only to be disappointed by the view (or lack of)? Have you ever seen a photo of a beautiful view and thought "THAT'S where I want to walk"? Yes? Walk This Way!

Walk This Way is a social media-come-walking routes hub that aims to link those seeking stunning scenery with those who are capturing them on camera.

Users can browse posts to find inspiration for their next adventure, or post their own hikes to celebrate and spur others on.
